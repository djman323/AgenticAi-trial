            <h2>What is Machine Learning?</h2>
            <p>
                Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can improve their performance on a specific task as they are exposed to more data.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Learns from labeled data. Examples include classification and regression.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> Learns from unlabeled data. Examples include clustering and dimensionality reduction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> Learns through trial and error, receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

            <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Algorithms:</strong> The core of machine learning, algorithms are sets of rules and statistical techniques used to learn patterns from data.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Data:</strong> Machine learning models learn from data, which can be in various forms such as numerical, text, or images.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Training:</strong> The process of feeding data to an algorithm so it can learn a model.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Model:</strong> The output of the training process, representing the learned patterns in the data.
